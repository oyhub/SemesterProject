            <h1>Exhibition Spaces</h1>
            <p>
              We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits. This is
              why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these
              exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the
              dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).

            <p>
              Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky
              and what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and
              galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.

              latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.

            <h2>Evolution</h2>
            <p>
              For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we
              come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework
              for exploring and understanding our place in this world.

            <p>
              Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You
              can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth,
              the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too

            <h2>Biology and medicine</h2>
            <p>
              From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights
              into the great wonders of the tiny world.
            </p>
            <p>
              For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to
              the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine
              and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart
              transplant.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals
              in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

              The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of the future.
              From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even say
              hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

            <p>
              As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes
              that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.
            </p>
            <p>
              In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming,
              extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a
              brighter future.

            <p>
              On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community
              Science Museum. It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the elements
              as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able
              to use and control wind to create power.
